          <p>
            Currently pursuing a full stack development certification from
            University of Penn with a graduation date of October 2022. Prior to
            my decision to change careers, I worked in the HVAC-R industry for
            almost 10 years. With this prior career comes years of diagnosing
            and repairing multiple types of electrical and mechanical equipment.
            With this experience and my acquired skills through University of
            Penn, I plan to combine the two in order to excel in my new career!.
